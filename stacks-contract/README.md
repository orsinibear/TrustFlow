## 🎯 Project Overview

**Ilenoid** is a production-ready decentralized application (dApp) that revolutionizes charity transparency by leveraging blockchain technology on **Stacks**. Every donation, milestone, and fund release is recorded immutably on-chain, ensuring complete accountability and trust.

### The Problem We Solve

Traditional charity platforms lack transparency. Donors lose track of funds once they leave their bank account, leading to:
- ❌ Donor fatigue and distrust
- ❌ Lack of accountability
- ❌ No way to verify fund usage
- ❌ Limited donor engagement

### Our Solution

✅ **Immutable Tracking**: Every STX and SIP-010 token tracked on-chain from donation to expenditure  
✅ **Milestone Governance**: Funds locked in smart contracts, released only after donor approval  
✅ **Weighted Voting**: Donors vote based on contribution amount (vote weight = donation amount)  
✅ **Radical Transparency**: All operations recorded on-chain with full visibility  
✅ **Low Fees**: Built on Stacks for affordable transactions  
✅ **Bitcoin Security**: Leverages Bitcoin's security through Stacks blockchain
