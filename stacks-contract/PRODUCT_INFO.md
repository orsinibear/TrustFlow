# Product Information

## Product Name:
**Ilenoid**

## Product Description:
Ilenoid is a production-ready decentralized application (dApp) that revolutionizes charity transparency by leveraging blockchain technology on Stacks. Every donation, milestone, and fund release is recorded immutably on-chain, ensuring complete accountability and trust.

The platform solves the critical problem of transparency in traditional charity platforms where donors lose track of funds once they leave their bank account. Ilenoid provides:

- **Immutable Tracking**: Every STX and SIP-010 token tracked on-chain from donation to expenditure
- **Milestone Governance**: Funds locked in smart contracts, released only after donor approval
- **Weighted Voting**: Donors vote based on contribution amount (vote weight = donation amount)
- **Radical Transparency**: All operations recorded on-chain with full visibility
- **Low Fees**: Built on Stacks for affordable transactions
- **Bitcoin Security**: Leverages Bitcoin's security through Stacks blockchain

Built with Next.js 16.1, Clarity 4 smart contracts, and Stacks Connect for seamless wallet integration, Ilenoid enables verified NGOs to create transparent fundraising projects with milestone-based funding and donor-governed fund releases.
